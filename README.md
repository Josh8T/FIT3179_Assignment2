# Unicorn Data Visualization
Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets.

This project creates a Unicorn company startup data visualization which is hosted on Github Pages, features several visualizations implemented using vega-lite in javascript.
